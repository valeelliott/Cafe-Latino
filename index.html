            <h1>Welcome to Volunteer International!</h1>
            <p>Our mission is to change the face of volunteer travel by helping children abroad in feeling supported in their learning journey. </p> 
              <p>Established in 2015, we have grown to become an international volunteer travel company, working in over 15 destinations around the world and placing thousands of volunteers abroad every year.</p>

              <p>We believe in a future where any traveler, anywhere in the world is empowered to make a meaningful difference in the community they are visiting, and we take pride in making this happen.</p>

              <p>We’re focused on providing affordable volunteer travel experiences that are responsible, safe and high quality.</p>

            <p>Volunteer International does not support volunteering in orphanages, whether undertaken by organised groups or individuals for short or longer periods of time. We pledge not to advertise these to our volunteers and we will endeavour to ensure that such opportunities are neither facilitated nor promoted within our institution.All of our volunteer opportunities take place at educational institutions and public libraries in need of help to support children's learning while at school.</p>
