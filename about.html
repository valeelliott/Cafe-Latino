            <h1>There is someone waiting to meet you on the other side of the world</h1>
            <p>Our non-profit organization is sponsored by the United Nations and is run by college volunteers. Our office is in the heart of Manhattan and is easily accessible by public transportation. </p>
              
            <p> We’re here for you from start to finish. We are happy to offer you an overview of what you can expect from us - and what you need to do next to join our global community of volunteer travelers.
              </p>
              <p>Most of our volunteers leave home on their own but return with incredible friendships that last a lifetime.</p>
              </p> 
              <p>Volunteering abroad is the best way to travel solo as it empowers you to make a difference within your host community, while exploring a new country in a meaningful way.
              </p>
              <p>
            <h3>Find the right match and follow your heart. Come visit us at our office in Manhattan!</h3>

            <h1>Program Goals</h1>
            <p>Our programs heighten global awareness and cultural understanding through the skills and expertise taken by volunteers to their host communities, and through the experiences and lessons that volunteers take back to their own countries and cultures. </p>
      
             <h3><p>We hope to meet you very soon!</p></h3>
